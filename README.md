## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive computational study of the fundamental properties of crystalline silicon (Si) using the **Quantum ESPRESSO** software suite. The project employs **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** to systematically characterize the structural, electronic, and vibrational properties of bulk silicon from first principles.

The primary objectives are:
-   To determine the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus through a careful convergence study and an equation of state analysis.
-   To calculate the electronic band structure and Density of States (DOS) to identify the nature and magnitude of the electronic band gap.
-   To compute the frequency of the zone-center optical phonon using *ab initio* Molecular Dynamics (MD).

Throughout the study, all calculated results are rigorously validated against established experimental values, highlighting both the predictive power and the known limitations of the PBE exchange-correlation functional.

## 2. Scientific Goal and Methodology

The core of this work is to leverage DFT to model crystalline silicon in its diamond cubic structure. All calculations were performed using the **Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)** functional within the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA). The interaction between ions and valence electrons was described by norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

## 3. Convergence and Structural Properties

A crucial first step in any DFT calculation is to ensure numerical convergence. We performed a systematic study to determine the optimal **kinetic energy cutoff (`ecutwfc`)** and **k-point mesh density**. Our analysis concluded that an energy cutoff of **55 Ry** and a **6x6x6** Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid provide results converged to within 1 mRy, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

| Energy vs. Ecut Convergence                      | Energy vs. K-Point Convergence                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Ecut Convergence](figure/en-ecut_conv_improved.png) | ![K-Point Convergence](figure/en-kpoint_conv_improved.png) |

With these converged parameters, we calculated the total energy for various lattice constants and fitted the data to the **Murnaghan equation of state**.

This analysis yielded the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus, which are in excellent agreement with experimental data:

| Property                             | Calculated (PBE) | Experimental |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------- |
| **Lattice constant, $a_0$ (\AA)**      | 5.416            | 5.431        |
| **Bulk modulus, $B_0$ (GPa)**        | 93.3             | 98           |
| **Relative Error ($a_0$)**           | -0.28%           | -            |

This slight underestimation is a well-known and expected characteristic of the PBE functional for covalently bonded semiconductors.

## 4. Electronic Properties: Band Structure and DOS

The electronic band structure and Density of States (DOS) were calculated to understand silicon's semiconductor nature.

The calculated band structure confirms that silicon is an **indirect band-gap semiconductor**, with the Valence Band Maximum (VBM) at the $\Gamma$ point and the Conduction Band Minimum (CBM) along the $\Gamma$-X direction. Our calculated indirect gap is **1.01 eV**.

The DOS analysis corroborates this finding, showing a clear energy gap of approximately 1.0 eV between the valence and conduction bands. Both results show the well-known underestimation of the experimental band gap (~1.17 eV), a typical limitation of standard DFT functionals.

## 5. Vibrational Properties: Phonon Frequency

The frequency of the zone-center optical phonon was determined using a direct method based on *ab initio* Molecular Dynamics. We excited the optical mode by displacing the atoms in the primitive cell and then simulated their evolution in a microcanonical (NVE) ensemble.

By performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the time evolution of the atomic displacement, we identified the dominant vibrational frequency.

| Atomic Displacement in MD                             | Fourier Spectrum of Displacement                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Phonon Oscillation](figure/displacement_time_clean.png) | ![Phonon Frequency](figure/frequency_spectrum.png) |

Our calculated frequency of **14.94 THz** is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of ~15.52 THz, with a relative error of only **-3.7%**. This result validates the accuracy of the interatomic forces predicted by our DFT model.
